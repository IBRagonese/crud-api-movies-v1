# CRUD-API-MOVIES-V1
## Introduction 
After completing the subject Computer-Science Lab. 3, I was assigned the task of creating a backend. This involves utilizing all the technologies learned throughout the course.
* **Node.js** for server hosting
* **MySQL** for database management
* **Postman** as API testing platforms
* **Jason Web Token** for user authentication and authorization
* **Microsoft VSCode, npm,** among other utilities
## Tools and Utilities
**Node.js** is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JS engine that allows JavaScript to be executed on the server side.
***
**Express.js** is a fast, minimalist web framework for Node.js that simplifies the creation of server-side applications. It provides robust features for building web and mobile applications, including middleware support and routing.
***
**MySQL** is a relation database management system (RDBMS) known for reliability and performance. It supports ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions to ensure database integrity. 
***
**Postman** is a development tool used to build, test, and document APIs. It supports HTTP methods including GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, which will be used in this project.
***
**JWT** (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. It is commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications.
***
**npm** (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js. It allows developers to install, manage, and share packages of code. It also helps in managing project dependencies.
